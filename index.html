        <p>Hello, my name is Cody Doerr and I am persuing a degree at Illinois State University for Game Design with a focus in Programming. </p>
        <p>I have completed 2 games noted below: Polar, a game where you act as a polar captain attempting to control the field of ice and steal the other team's flag. The other game is Plunder the Present, a 2D metroidvania set in modern cities following  pirates who finds themselves marooned in the present day. To excape, you must find all of the fuel spread throughout the levels and get back to your time. Also noted are presentations and art pieces I created in the Introduction to Creative Design class at Illinois State University. </p>
        <p>I some day hope to work for a company who works in the best interest of children with disabilities developmentally, hoping to implement games that help them cope with every day life and build up their strengths and fortify their weaknesses so that they can continue into life worry free.</p>
